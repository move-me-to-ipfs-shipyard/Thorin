i am find program, i say:

- automated index - i crawl torrent network, forming the index of files
- query the whole index - i exchange indexes with other find programs so we each have the whole index to query
- index is just data in db - i extract file info and show seeds (pins)
- automatic index echange - we, find programs, discover each other and exchange the list of files
